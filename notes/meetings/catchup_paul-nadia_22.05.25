They have a candidate vaccine for S. aureus -> protein based: construct with multiple S. aureus proteins linked together into one protein

Reese Langley: looking at 6 circulating strains of S. aureus that explains 95% of the infections globally
-> covers all of those: focus on these different 6 stains:
    - 

Prefered protein database: UniProt, Pfam (interpro)

How to get sequence motifs of antigens - automate looking for candidate antigens of different pathogen:
- Paul knows absolutely nothing about: find some machine learnign tools
- look for in previous publications and literature based on experimental validations
    -> most people use complete proteins (not chopped up into domains): least well conserved parts of the protein (c and n ends of proteins)

List of ideas:
- if we have poor literature: what are the features that make something a reasonable antigen candidate:
    - exported: signal peptides - annotated: from SignalP
    - transmembrane proteins: predict if they are interal and external
    - external proteins
    - cell-wall anchored proteins
    - toxins - have to consider how rapidly the toxin changes (evolution)
    - things that are under positive selection - e.g. spike protein is one of the fastest changing molecules: 100+ non-synonymous changes and only 4 synonymous changes compared to the wuhan
        -> change the vaccine often enough (what we do now with flu and covid)
        -> cheap for mRNA but expensive testing
- how would I find the different features from each pathogen
- could use evolutionary information - jackhammer (self-made alignments, multiple iterations), eggnog (protein full length alignment database)* based on JUST the 6 genomes
=> How would I make a pipeline
get the corresponding proteomes from the different species, 


1. get the epitopes from IEDB
2. map to the genome of the pathogen - find out the motifs and features why these are good epitopes
3. find more potential antigens from that information
4. get the epitopes/predict the epitopes from each antigens from pathogens
5. take the epitopes - and see if they conform for any of the features
6. use data for training model

+ use existing patents for training data
+ vaccine databases for training data
+ epitope databases for training data
=> train own model
