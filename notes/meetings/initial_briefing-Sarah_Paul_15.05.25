Meeting - Sarah & Paul
Aim: for nz to have a platform with tools for each pillars - should there be a new outbreak of some disease, we can run from target selection to therapeutic testing

RNA platform - report to co-directors Gary Evans (CEO), Kirsten ... (CEO) , Neb (COO)

along with the team, MB (entre manufacturing and epidemic readiness) + leadership team


3 projects (flagships): decided by end of may and early june
- human health
- human health
- agricultural space (animal health)

-> could be human health, agriculture, or conservation

mRNA, a little of the target protein expressed in usually human muscle cells

Target selection: stage 1 -> payload design -> formulation -> preclinical testing -> research grade manufacturing (make mRNA and encapsulation)(SERVICE)-> advisor QC and development -> commercial grade process development and manufacture (SCALING in NZ - previous experience not in mRNA products) -> clinical testing (not necessarily clinical trials)

Biotech (SARAH WORKS THERE)-> mRNA commercial grade manufacturing - mRNA factories based in Melbourne

e.g. if we want to get rid of strep A -> how to find a good target for an mRNA based vaccine/therapeutics

Step 1: reviewing what software and previous literature available for selecting a good antigen target from some pathogen/cancer 
-e.g. positive selection genes - important and interacting with the human immune system
-> e.g. covid now circulating has 100+ synonymous changes while only 4 non-synonymous changes

build some assemblies and screen through genes in a pathogen where potential mRNA vaccine targets would be effective to prime the immune system

look at exports -> do any of the proteins have export peptides attached: more likely to interact with the human immune system
look at toxins -> e.g. H pylori - positive selection and exported out of the bacteria (not required for the growth of the bacteria) - lessen the damage/severity of the infection 
transmembrane protein domains; extracellular targets


can we design mRNAs that are expressed in specific target cells - tissue specificity (DESIGN PILLAR) - MOSTLY IRRELEVANT
RNA stability - structure and RNA stability in terms of degradation

Start thinking about:
Target selection: build an indication agnostic pipeline to identify the best targets
-> prophylactic mRNA vaccines and therapeutic immunotherapy mRNA - different 

START HERE: make pipelines:
- for infectious disease: antigens, build immunity, right part of the antigens (instead of making the protein directly, it is encoded to an mRNA): find the specific fragment/region and design and possibilities may affect the target selection

- for cancer: cancer immunotherapeutic is more complicated  - re-purposable for other diseases (cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases)

different strategies to start:

1. literature reviews - initially you don't need to reinvent the wheel - use and improve on existing software and pipelines (tools), identify some candidate approaches and data

2. putting together some test datasets - what are some successful mRNA vaccine targets - putt out some target proteins matched with the genome (handy for prototyping)

other team members Zahid - working on the project 2 days a week (experimental biologists) help with understanding the biology, patent database (sequence search tools), publication database, and putting together datasets

As soon as we can get a prediction/ list of antigen targets - Zahid can do experimental validation (tests will look like knockout mutations, immunogenic assays, make mRNA constructs, rapid screening platform to test multiple mRNA constructs (higher throughput - minimum is 5-10, likely tens of constructs))
-> inform predictions to make it a bit better - many iterations until good performance


also Alex and team - based in Australia Sydney & Italy (fold AI cofounder for RNA): subcontracted to help with this work - more AI models/ more elaborate AI models
-> plenty of AI models - comparing the performances of existing AI models (simple machine learning approaches to see if it is approachable)
-> once we find the good characteristics and properties: then we can make a more sophisticated models

distribute workloads with the dev team

Weekly - semiregular code reviews with Paul team
Monthly catchups - or more with specific teams
Time wise: best case 10 AM NZ time (TBD consult with everybody)
NOVEMBER MEETING IN AUCKLAND

CONNECT WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TEAM - ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS IN CASE OTHERS HAVE FOUND THE ANSWERS
